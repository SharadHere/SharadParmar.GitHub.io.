   expectations and investment strategies. A better understanding of policy outcomes is made possible by the CPI's insights into the influence and efficacy of the Federal 
   Reserve's monetary policies. The CPI is a flexible and useful dataset that is used as a teaching tool in educational settings for topics like economics, finance, and 
   related disciplines.
